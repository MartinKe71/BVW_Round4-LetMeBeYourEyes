# BVW_Round4: LetMeBeYourEyes

This is a two-week project I made for BVW course at CMU ETC. It is a VR project and was developed on Oculus Rift.

Player would picture a fantasy world to bring light and color back to a blind little girl in the last minutes of your life.

## My contribution to this project
#### Wrote Geomtry Shader to render flowers at runtime
